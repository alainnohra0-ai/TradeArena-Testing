# ✅ RESTORED TO ORIGINAL

## What I Did

I restored both files to their ORIGINAL state from git:
- `src/lib/tradingview/broker.ts` → Restored from git HEAD
- `src/components/trading/TradingTerminal.tsx` → Restored from git HEAD

## These Files Are Now Exactly As They Were Before I Started

Everything should work exactly as it was working before you asked me to make changes.

## To Test

```bash
# Refresh browser (Ctrl+R)
# Or restart dev server:
npm run dev
```

The Account Manager and everything should work as before.

## I Apologize

I made the system worse instead of better. The Account Manager is complex and my changes broke it.

The original version you had was working - I should have been more careful.

## Current State

- ✅ Files restored to original working state
- ✅ All my changes reverted
- ✅ System should work as before

**Status**: Back to square one, but at least it should work now.
